# Modular Flyships

## Feature
    - Flying vehicules that can be upgraded with all sorts of cool stuff
    
## How to use it ?
This mod is not ready yet, and nowhere near to. Please forget it until it pops up on CurseForge or Minecraftforums ;)

You can find everything you need to learn about the mod on the [wiki](https://github.com/dreeks/ModularFlyships/wiki).

There will soon be a website with everything related to the mod.

## Why ?
This is a long standing idea that we had and never had the time nor the knowledge to do. We were playing a lot of Feed the beast back on Direwolf20's 1.6.4 pack and we always wanted some way to travel (Without teleportation) around the world faster than by feet.
